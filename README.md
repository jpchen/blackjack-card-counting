## üß† Strategy Guide

### **Card Counting Basics (Hi-Lo System)**
- **Low cards (2-6)**: +1 each (favors dealer, count goes up)
- **Neutral cards (7-9)**: 0 each (no effect on count)
- **High cards (10-A)**: -1 each (favors player, count goes down)

**Why it works**: High cards benefit the player (more blackjacks, better doubling), low cards benefit the dealer (less busting on stiff hands).

### **True Count Conversion**
- **Formula**: Running Count √∑ Decks Remaining
- **Example**: Running count +6 with 3 decks left = True count +2
- **Betting guidance**: 
  - True count +1 or less: Minimum bet
  - True count +2: Small advantage, modest bet increase
  - True count +3 or higher: Significant advantage, larger bets

### **Kelly Criterion Betting**
The app calculates optimal bet sizes using the Kelly Criterion:
- **Edge calculation**: (True Count - 1) √ó 0.5%
- **Kelly percentage**: Edge √∑ Blackjack Variance (1.35)
- **Safety caps**: Never bet more than 25% of bankroll
- **Minimum bets**: Always bet at least 1% of bankroll

### **Basic Strategy Highlights**
- **Always split**: Aces and 8s
- **Never split**: 5s and 10s
- **Double on 11**: Against any dealer card except Ace
- **Double on 10**: Against dealer 2-9
- **Stand on 17+**: Always stand on hard 17 or higher
- **Hit 16 vs 7+**: Hit 16 against dealer 7, 8, 9, 10, A
