# Blackjack Card Counting Web App

This is a simple Blackjack web app with a card counting feature (Hi-Lo system) for practice. The UI is designed to resemble the provided screenshot, with game actions following standard Blackjack rules including hit, stand, double, and split (when applicable).

## How to Run Locally

1. Ensure you have the files in your local directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. No server is required as it's a static app, but if you encounter issues with local file policies, you can use a simple local server like `python -m http.server` in the directory and access http://localhost:8000.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push all files to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
2. Go to your repository on GitHub.
3. Click on "Settings" > "Pages".
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch", choose `main` branch, and `/ (root)` directory.
5. Click "Save".
6. The app will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
7. It may take a few minutes for the site to deploy initially.

Note: The repo is named `blackjack-card-counting`, so the app includes a display for running and true count to aid in card counting practice. If this is not desired or needs adjustments, let me know.
